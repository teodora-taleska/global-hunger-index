# Global Hunger Index Data Analysis

This project explores the Global Hunger Index (GHI) using data from Kaggle. The GHI is a critical tool for measuring and tracking hunger worldwide. This README provides an overview of the project's key components and analyses.

## Introduction

Hunger remains a significant global challenge, impacting millions of lives. This project delves into the GHI to better understand and address this issue.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: [Global Hunger Index Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/the-global-hunger-index). It includes essential information related to GHI scores, underweight children, child wasting, and child stunting across various countries and years.

## Key Analyses

1. **Average Global Hunger Index per Country:** This analysis calculates the average GHI score for each country.

2. **Average Prevalence of Underweight Children:** It computes the average prevalence of underweight children for each country over multiple years.

3. **Minimum and Maximum Prevalence of Underweight Children:** This analysis identifies the minimum and maximum prevalence of underweight children across the years for each country.

4. **Average Prevalence of Child Wasting:** It calculates the average prevalence of child wasting for each country over time.

5. **Change in Child Wasting Prevalence:** This analysis provides insights into whether child wasting prevalence has increased or decreased over time.

6. **Average Prevalence of Stunting:** It determines the average prevalence of child stunting for each country.

## Conclusion

This project sheds light on the critical issue of global hunger by analyzing the Global Hunger Index data. The analyses help us better understand trends and challenges related to hunger and malnutrition.
